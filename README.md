# InfoSecGL
## Current meetup is every 3rd Thursday 7pm-9pm in Airs & Graces pub, Cheltenham (venue is subject to change)
We're a community of infosec folks in Gloucestershire, England. Everyone is welcome whether you're a pro, an amateur or just a wannabe! Our aim is to chat about security, help each other out with questions and projects, and provide a social setting for all of this.

The core collaborative group spans a wide range of infosec companies, government and charities. We hope this will ensure no one place has any over-riding influence, and will prevent the organising burden resting precariously on only one or two people. If youâ€™d also like to be more involved please do reach out.
